Hi, welcome.

My name is Keyue, currently a student studying computer science at University of California, San Diego. I've interned at some awesome places, done a few cool projects and had the honor to meet lots of smart people that helped me get to where I am today.

I am interested industry and research opportunities. I enjoy working at a fast paced environment, collaborating with amazing engineers and bouncing ideas (sometimes ping pong balls) off each other. In my spare time, I like running, playing boardgames and trying out new recipes.

If you have some opportunities you think I'd be interested in, please contact me. Looking forward to hearing from you!
