Hi, welcome.

My name is Keyue, currently a student studying computer science at University of California, San Diego. I've interned at some awesome places, done a few cool projects and had the honor to meet lots of smart people that helped me get to where I am today.

I am interested in internships and research. I enjoy working at a fast paced environment, collaborating with smart engineers and bouncing ideas (sometimes ping pong balls) off each other. In my spare time, I like fencing, playing boardgames and making desserts. I hope to leave this world a better place than I entered it, in whatever small and insignificant ways I can.

If you have some opportunities you think I'd be interested in, or even recipes you'd to share, please contact me through the mail icon on the left. Looking forward to hearing from you!
